> This notebook is my journey through analyzing loan data to identify key factors contributing to loan default risk. My goal was to uncover actionable insights that could inform risk management strategies and improve lending decisions.

## General Information

- My project revolves around the analysis of loan data to explore the underlying factors that contribute to the risk of default.
- The background of my project is rooted in the financial industry's challenge of managing loan default risk effectively.
- The business problem I aimed to solve is the high rate of loan defaults and its impact on lenders' portfolios.
- I used a comprehensive loan dataset that includes various features such as Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio, loan amount, interest rates, employment history, and borrowers' housing status.

## Technologies Used

- Pandas - version 1.2.4
- NumPy - version 1.19.5
- Matplotlib - version 3.3.4
- Seaborn - version 0.11.1

## Conclusions

- My analysis unveiled that higher DTI ratios are strongly correlated with an increased likelihood of loan default, suggesting the need for lenders to weigh this indicator more heavily.
- I found that larger loan amounts are associated with a higher risk of default, indicating a potential need for stricter scrutiny for higher loan applications.
- Interest rates play a critical role; loans with higher interest rates tend to have higher default rates, pointing towards the necessity of a balanced approach in interest rate setting.
- Surprisingly, employment length had minimal impact on default rates, challenging the conventional wisdom that job stability correlates with loan repayment reliability.
- Housing status, particularly renting, was identified as a slight risk factor, suggesting that housing stability could influence loan repayment capability.

## Acknowledgements

- This project was inspired by my interest in the financial sector's risk management challenges and the desire to apply data analysis to solve real-world problems.
- I owe a debt of gratitude to several financial analysis tutorials and datasets provided by [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/) for making their data available for educational purposes.
